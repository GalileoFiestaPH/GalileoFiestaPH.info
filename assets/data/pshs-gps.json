      "text": "A simple GPS setup can be used to determine location, altitude, velocity, date and time, as well as record a GPS track.<br><br>The activity may be a treasure hunt style game, where objectives are hidden at different locations (minimum of 3.0 m radius between locations). It may also be used in conjunction with field surveys and studies where the precise geographic location is needed. An alternate activity may be for tracking the subject for map-reading exercises."
